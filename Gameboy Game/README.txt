WELCOME TO THE GAME- SPACE RIDE!



THIS GAME CONSISTS OF 5 SCREENS- WELCOME SCREEN, INSTRUCTIONS SCREEN, GAME SCREEN, WIN SCREEN AND LOSE SCREEEN.


THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME IS TO DODGE THE ASTEROIDS USING YOUR SPACESHIP AND SURVIVE UNTIL YOU SCORE ABOVE 25.
THERE ARE 5 ASTEROIDS FLOATING AROUND IN THE SPACE AND YOUR SPACESHIP MUST AVOID COLLIDING WITH ANY OF THEM IN ORDER TO SURVIVE and SCORE.


TO WIN, YOU NEED TO SCORE ABOVE 25. YOU HAVE 4 LIVES IN TOTAL. EACH TIME YOU LOSE A LIFE BY COLLIDING WITH THE ASTEROIDS, THE GAME CHECKS FOR YOUR SCORE.
IF THE SCORE IS ABOVE 25, IT TAKES YOU TO THE WIN SCREEN AND THE GAME IS OVER. 
ELSE, IT DECREEMENTS THE LIVES COUNTER BY 1 AND RESUMES THE GAME UNTIL THE LIVES COUNTER BECOMES 0. ONCE THE NUMBER OF LIVES BECOMES 0, IT TAKES YOU TO THE LOSE SCREEN.


DURING THE GAME AFTER THE COUNTDOWN IS DONE, IF THE PLAYER HITS BACKSPACE HE IS TAKEN BACK TO THE WELCOME SCREEN AND THE GAME STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.
YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO PLAY AGAIN BY HITTING ENTER ONCE YOU REACH THE LOSE/WIN SCREEN. ON HITTING ENTER, IT DIRECTS YOU TO THE INSTRUCTIONS SCREEN AND THE GAME STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.
